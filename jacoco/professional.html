<h1>Professional Code Coverage</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Project deadline is approaching? The application probably works but you don't have time left to write tests?</li>
  <li>Due to the special nature of your project it is hard to identify testable units or any units at all?</li>
  <li>The project was started when unit testing was not yet a thing?</li>
  <li>Your very experienced developers should focus their valuable work hours on the implementation instead of wasting time on testing?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  so familiar... instead of taking the cumbersome task of writing tests you can now simply improve your code coverage reports!
  Meet - <b>ProCoCo</b>! As of today (01.04.2019) we're proud to announce our commercial extension of JaCoCo - Professional Code Coverage (<b>ProCoCo</b>).
  Improve your code coverage report without any test effort!
</p>

<h2>Service Details</h2>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p><b>ProCoCo</b> allows you to directly exclude any line of source code or even mark it as covered. All you need is to purchase credit packages and then spend credits to improve the quality reports for your code base line by line. With every package purchase we hand you a unique key. Only with this key you can add your excluded lines into the JaCoCo Block Chain (JaBloCha). Only if the line is part of the block chain it will be excluded from the reports, even if reports are created at a later point in time.</p>

<h3>Can we use it for our proprietary code?</h3>

<p>Yes, of course, and do not worry - only secure hashes of the lines are stored in the JaCoBloCha. Therefore it is impossible to re-calculate the original code from the hashes.</p>

<h3>If we have a lot of duplicated code, do we need to pay separately?</h3>

<p>No, not at all. Every line whose hash is identical to the one already presented in blockchain, will also be excluded or marked as covered.<p>

<p>Furthermore you do not need to pay and write tests when copying code that was already added to JaCoBloCha by someone else - just make sure to do exact copy.</p>

<h3>What happens if I modify a already excluded line?</h3>

<p>In this case you have to add the new version of the line to the JaCoBloCha with purchased credits. But we do not recommend touching untested code anyways. Better create a copy of it. You can safely keep the old code in your code base as long as you excluded it from code coverage. It will not harm your code coverage reports. When the code was marked as covered, it will even continue to improve the quality.</p>

<h3>Will the JaCoCo block chain really be based on distributed computing?</h3>

<p>Sure. And it's actually quite easy for us. The miners are implemented in JavaScript and will be integrated directly into the JaCoCo HTML reports. From our calculations this way we get more computing power from people staring at their code coverage reports than any other popular block chain has.</p>

<p>At a later stage we might open the block chain to people who want to write tests for excluded lines and get refunds from the block chain.</p>
